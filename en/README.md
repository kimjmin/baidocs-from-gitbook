# Introduction

## Backend.AI

Backend.AI is an open source based AI Infrastructure operating platform, which makes it easy to utilize virtualized compute resource clusters in a cloud or on-premises environment. Based on container technology, which efficiently provides multiple independent operating environments on top of a physical server, it enables safe execution of code in resource-constrained environments without platform constraints, and the ability to use a wide variety of AI frameworks, high-performance computing workloads, and programming languages without complex setup.



This streamlines the entire workflow—from massive distributed model training to inference, supporting multi-node, multi-tenant—through robust pipeline management. Backend.AI ensures that all processes are executed securely, dynamically, and concurrently in one single software platform.



Backend.AI is purpose-built to operate high-density computing clusters that include GPUs and heterogeneous accelerators. Lablup’s proprietary container-level GPU virtualization technology enables a single GPU to be partitioned into multiple smaller virtual GPUs, allowing numerous models to be trained simultaneously and increase GPU utilization by up to 400%. This approach makes it possible to use enterprise-grade GPUs and AI accelerators-often costing thousands to millions of dollars-much more efficiently.

The platform runs on both cloud and on-premises clusters, leveraging its own orchestration and job scheduler, Sokovan. Backend.AI is a vendor-agnostic accelerated workload hosting platform that supports distributed deep learning training, high-performance AI model serving, ultra-low cost and latency for GPU-based AI models, and compatibility with various AI chips. These optimizations empower organizations to deploy, manage, and scale AI workloads flexibly and cost-effectively across a wide range of infrastructure environments.

Backend.AI offers a variety of performance-driven optimizations for machine learning and high-performance computing clusters, along with management and research features to support a diverse users, including researchers, administrators, and DevOps. Enterprise Edition adds support for multi-domain management, a dedicated Control-Panel for superadmins, and the GPU virtualization plug-in.

## WebUI

A GUI client package is provided to easily take advantage of the features supported by the Backend.AI server. Backend.AI Web-UI is a GUI client in the form of a web service or stand-alone app. It provides a convenient graphical interface for accessing the Backend.AI server to utilize computing resources and manage its environment. Backend.AI provides pre-made images which enable immediate creation of compute sessions without any need of installing separate programs. Most tasks can be done with mouse clicks and brief typing, which achieves more intuitive use.
