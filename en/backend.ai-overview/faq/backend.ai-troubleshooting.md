# Backend.AI Troubleshooting

## Malicious contents installation error on macOS











## Session list not displayed correctly

Due to intermittent network problems or other various reasons, the session list may not be displayed correctly. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

### Web-based Web-UI:

* **Refresh the Browser Page**: Use the shortcut provided by browsers such as **Ctrl (Command)+R** to refresh the page. Since the browser's cache may cause troubles sometimes, it is recommended to refresh the page bypassing the cache (such as **Shift+Ctrl (Command)+R**, but the keys may differ in each browser).

### Web-UI App:

* **Refresh the App**: Press the **Ctrl (Command)+R** shortcut to refresh the app.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve most session list display issues. If the problem persists, please contact our customer support team for further assistance.

## Unable to login

If you encounter problems with login due to authentication cookie recognition issues, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Try Logging in with a Private Browser Window**:
   * Use your browser's private mode (e.g., Incognito mode in Chrome, Private Browsing in Firefox) to attempt login. Since private windows do not save cookies or cache, this can bypass cookie-related problems.
2. **Clear Browser Cache and Application Data if Login Succeeds**:
   * If you successfully log in using a private window, proceed to clear your browser's cache and application data. This can be done through the browser settings:
     * **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data > Select Cached images and files, Cookies and other site data, then click Clear data.
     * **Firefox**: Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data > Clear Data.
     * **Safari**: Safari menu > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data > Remove All Website Data.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve login issues. If the problem persists, please contact our customer support team for further assistance.

## Broken page layout

Backend.AI leverages the latest modern JavaScript and browser features to provide an optimal user experience. To ensure the page layout displays correctly:

* **Use the latest versions of browsers**: We recommend using the most recent versions of browsers to take full advantage of the advanced features and ensure compatibility with our WebUI.

If you encounter layout issues, please update your browser to the latest version. If the problem persists, contact our customer support team for further assistance.
