<figure><img src="../images/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Start tab in Backend.AI serves as a quick-access dashboard, allowing users to efficiently initiate frequently used actions. This page consolidates essential operations into easily accessible cards, streamlining the workflow for both new and experienced users.

## **Overview of Main Components**

<figure><img src="../images/start.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The Start tab displays four primary action cards, each providing a brief description and a button to begin the corresponding task.&#x20;
* These cards are designed to help users quickly create storage, start sessions for computation, or deploy models as services.

## **Card Descriptions**

### 1. Create New Storage Folder

* Create a new storage folder to organize and upload files. Storage folders are essential for managing datasets, model files, and any other resources required for training or serving models.

### 2. Start Interactive Session

* Launch an interactive session for model training. This session provides a computational environment where you can run code, test models, and interact with datasets in real time.

### 3. Start Batch Session

* Initiate a batch session for executing predefined scripts or scheduled tasks. Batch sessions are suitable for running jobs that do not require user interaction and can be scheduled to run automatically.

### 4. Start Model Service

* Deploy a trained model as a service to share with others or integrate with external applications. This action creates a model service endpoint for real-time inference or API access.
