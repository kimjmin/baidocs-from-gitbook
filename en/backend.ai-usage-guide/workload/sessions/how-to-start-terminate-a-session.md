## Terminate a compute session

To terminate a specific session, simply click on the red power icon and click 'OKAY' button in the dialog. Since the data in the folder inside the compute session is deleted as soon as the compute session ends, it is recommended to move the data to the mounted folder or upload it to the mounted folder from the beginning.
